/**
 * EXPLAIN
 * I like to add some util classes to be used in the app.
 * But if possible, I like to avoid full fleged util class like tailwind, as code readability gets hurt with tailwind,
 * along with other issues like difficulty in code refactoring
 * Ideally I'll define utilities in separate files like:
 * - text.util.scss
 * - layout.util.scss
 * - colors.util.scss
 * - utils.scss (import everything from above here)
